# Caching for mobile users in edge networks
_Masters Thesis at [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl)_.

See [repository.tudelft.nl](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:c27c8d2e-6ba4-406b-b8d3-4fbcd49c480d) for the associated work.

This repository contains the source code and other supplemental material to my Masters Thesis.  While I included some documentation throughout the repo Thesis document itself contains most of the rational and explanations.

The structure of the repo is as follows:
- `dataset/` contains the source code related to the retrieval of the dataset used.
- `simulation/generator` contains the source code related to the different trace generators.
- `simulation/evaluator` contains the source code related to the different strategies: Belady's MIN, LRU, Cooperative LRU, Profiles, and Federated.
- `experiments/` contains Jupyter Notebooks that explain the different experiments, the same experiments are exported into regular Python files to be used for larger runs.

If you have any questions feel free to contact me (see my Github profile for contact options).
